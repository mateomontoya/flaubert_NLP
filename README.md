# Flaubert Digital Humanities -- Analyzing Edits to Style and Grammar of the Eight Different Drafts of *Madame Bovary* by Flaubert

A Natural Language Processing project working on the 8 different drafts on Flaubert's Madame Bovary and assessing changes in style, grammar, and word choice.

## The Data

The data was gathered by Geoff Bacon. Full documentation on its collection is found in data/documentation

The original HTML data had many complex tags in it, allowing us to separate out the margins which Flaubert wrote on, the words he struck through in draft versions, and permutations of these ideas throughout. Ultimately, we divided the original HTML gathered from bovary.fr into 13 different columns.

## Initial Analysis

Staying with the eight different drafts of *Madame Bovary*, the initial analysis primarily compares similarities and differences between the different versions. This encompasses word choice, sentence length, quantity of edits and strike throughs made, and several other factors.
