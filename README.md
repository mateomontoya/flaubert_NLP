# Flaubert Digital Humanities Project -- Analyzing Style and Edits of the Eight Different Drafts of *Madame Bovary* by Flaubert

A Digital Humanities and Natural Language Processing project working on the 8 different drafts on Flaubert's Madame Bovary and assessing changes in style, grammar, and word choice.

Principal Investigator: Ramona Naddaff

Research Assistant: Mateo Montoya

UC Berkeley D-Lab Consultant: Adam Anderson

## The Data

The data was gathered by Geoff Bacon. Full documentation on its collection is found in data/documentation

The original HTML data had many complex tags in it, allowing us to separate out the margins which Flaubert wrote on, the words he struck through in draft versions, and permutations of these ideas throughout. Ultimately, we divided the original HTML gathered from bovary.fr into 13 different columns.

Treating full length texts which are similar as a dataset presents challenges to any established NLP or Digital Humanities pipeline. On top of this, the fact that the works are written in French eliminates the possibility of using some of the more stabilized Parts of Speech taggers and other kits. The data which is the foundation of this project presented technical challenges at nearly every corner.

## Initial Analysis

Staying with the eight different drafts of *Madame Bovary*, the initial analysis primarily compares similarities and differences between the different versions. This encompasses word choice, sentence length, quantity of edits and strike throughs made, and several other factors.

These findings work in tandem with the literary and historical analysis conducted by the principal investigator, Professor Ramona Naddaff. I worked to both generate insights and incorporate these insights into a full length argument being pursued in a book length manuscript still in progress.
